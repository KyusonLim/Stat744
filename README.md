Double donut chart (double pie chart): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26748069/ggplot2-pie-and-donut-chart-on-same-plot

I think this is creative and useful for showing each sub-proportion of the proportion so to see in beautiful colored mapped chart.  
In this graph, people are able to compare for medical conditions of age groups.
Also, notice very evidently for which groups are volnuerable to COVID-19 of health conditions.

Cons: relative comparison are very obvious.
Age groups of people will be compared to find which groups are volunerable to ICU, intubated hospitalization.
Not numbers, but pie chart of probability comparison is very obvious and critically compared. 
Most importanly, within group comparison is highly comparable.
